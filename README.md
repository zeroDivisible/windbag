**Reasoning**:

This projects is easing the pain of doing ad-hoc testing of TCP based servers. It shouldn't be even considered alpha - this is a project, whose only purpose was to make me use [dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/), [netty](http://netty.io/) and [emberjs](http://emberjs.com/) - I didn't had an opportunity to do so during my normal job and always wanted to do something more ambitious with those two frameworks.

Readme will be updated as more features will be added.
